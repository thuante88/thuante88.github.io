I started in Cyber Security studies in traditional community college with plans to go in a uni to ultimatley become a STEM teacher at a local high school and have my own classroom after being a Substitute Teacher for thepast 3 years. But I like to build and sit in front of a screen while I work if I'm not leading a classroom. I still want to get my bachelor's to teach but me and my kids need something more steady than what I've got now. This path isn't going to be short term. Selfishly speaking, this course will put me into a field I have know since I was a kid avoiding my next asthma attack from being outside on a bad day. No this isn't to get rich quick. This is to get a steady job and build on field experience until I can get my own classroom and students. This is to make life better for my kids and myself. If I can face high schoolers and get them to straighten out enough to graduate on time than me completeing Flatiron is possible.
